Notes for the mosaik simulation.

Models needed: params, [external variables]

house -- [light, temperature]
heater -- on/off, set rate, status ok or not, [temperature]
lamp -- (on/off,) variation, color, status ok or not, [light]
coffee machine -- on/off, coffee ready, on/off, beans_level, time needed to prepare coffee, status ok or not
sound system -- on/off, song, sound level, status ok or not
curtains -- open/close, light emitted from outside? link with weather, or sun
weather
clock

The models are set in utils.py
Then simulations classes need to be set up.
Control Rules are set in a simulation class as well
Collector to retrieve the data

RuleEngine affects all models except weather


Scenario

Which components to connect and how ?

house - heater
house - lamp
curtains - weather?
lamp - curtains ?
all to ruleEngine
all to collector

use PV solar for help for the light 
look at weather data
